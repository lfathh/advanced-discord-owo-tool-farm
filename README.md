## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### General Questions

**Q: Is this tool safe to use?**

A: The tool is open source and you can review the code yourself. However, using any automation tool carries risks. Always use at your own discretion and follow Discord's Terms of Service.

**Q: Will I get banned for using this?**

A: There's always a risk when using automation tools. We've implemented safety features like random delays and captcha solving, but we cannot guarantee your account's safety.

**Q: Does this work on mobile?**

A: Yes! You can use it on Android via Termux. iOS support is not available yet.

**Q: Is this tool free?**

A: Yes, the tool is completely free. However, some services like captcha solving APIs require payment to their respective providers.

### Setup & Installation

**Q: I get "npm is not recognized" error**

A: You need to install Node.js first. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and make sure to restart your terminal.

**Q: The tool won't start after installation**

A: Make sure you've run `npm install` first. If issues persist, try:
```bash
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

**Q: How do I get my Discord token?**

A: See our [Get Token](#get-token) section above. Never share your token with anyone!

**Q: Where do I put my configuration file?**

A: Create a file named `config.json` in the same folder as the tool, or use `npm start generate config.json` to create a template.

### Configuration Issues

**Q: What channels should I use for farming?**

A: Use channels where OwO bot is active and you have permission to send messages. Private servers work best.

**Q: How do I set up webhooks for notifications?**

A: Create a webhook in your Discord server settings, copy the URL, and paste it in the `webhookURL` field in your config.

**Q: Which captcha API should I choose?**

A: Both 2captcha and yescaptcha work well. Choose based on pricing and availability in your region.

**Q: What's the difference between autoGem values?**

A: 
- `0`: Disabled
- `1`: Upgrade gems (fabled → common)  
- `-1`: Downgrade gems (common → fabled)

### Troubleshooting

**Q: Tool stops working after a while**

A: This usually happens due to:
- Rate limiting (use `autoSleep: true`)
- Captcha detection (make sure captcha API is configured)
- Token expiration (re-login required)

**Q: Captcha solving is not working**

A: Check:
- Your API key is correct and has balance
- `captchaAPI` is set to "2captcha" or "yescaptcha"
- Your internet connection is stable

**Q: Getting "Invalid token" error**

A: Your token may have expired. Get a new token using the methods in [Get Token](#get-token) section.

**Q: Notifications are not working**

A: Verify:
- Webhook URL is correct and accessible
- Admin ID is your correct user ID
- Music file path exists (for music notifications)

**Q: Tool crashes with "ECONNRESET" error**

A: This is usually a network issue. Try:
- Checking your internet connection
- Using a VPN
- Restarting the tool

### Features & Usage

**Q: How does auto huntbot work?**

A: When enabled, the tool automatically sends and receives huntbot, and can upgrade traits using the specified trait type.

**Q: What does "useAdotfAPI" do?**

A: This uses our custom API for enhanced huntbot captcha solving. It's currently free during beta.

**Q: Can I run multiple accounts?**

A: You can run multiple instances with different config files, but be careful about rate limiting.

**Q: How often should I run the tool?**

A: Use `autoSleep: true` for random breaks. Continuous running increases ban risk.

**Q: What's the best configuration for safety?**

A: Enable:
- `autoSleep: true`
- `autoResume: true` 
- Configure captcha API
- Use moderate delays between commands

### Advanced Questions

**Q: Can I modify the code?**

**Q: How do I contribute to the project?**

A: Check our [Contributing](#contributing) section. We welcome bug reports, feature requests, and translations.

**Q: Why is my gem management not working?**

A: Make sure:
- `autoGem` is not set to 0
- `gemTier` array contains the gems you want to use
- You have enough gems in your inventory

**Q: The tool updates but my config is reset**

A: Your config should be preserved. If lost, regenerate it with `npm start generate config.json` and reconfigure.
